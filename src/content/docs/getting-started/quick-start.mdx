You can run RIOT on most IoT devices, on open-access testbed hardware (e.g.
IoT-lab), and also directly as a process on your Linux or FreeBSD machine (we
call this the `native` port). Try it right now in your terminal window:

    If you are new to RIOT, you might want to read through the Getting Started guide. It provides a more detailed introduction to RIOT and its features.

    If you are already familiar with RIOT, you can proceed with the Quick Start guide.

```bash title="Quick Start Instructions"
git clone https://github.com/RIOT-OS/RIOT.git # assumption: git is pre-installed
cd RIOT # Move to the RIOT directory
git checkout <LATEST_RELEASE>   # Checkout the latest release, 
                                # you can find them under
                                # https://github.com/RIOT-OS/RIOT/tags
sudo ./dist/tools/tapsetup/tapsetup    # create virtual Ethernet
                                       # interfaces to connect multiple
                                       # RIOT instances
cd examples/default/ # Move to the default example
make all # Build the default example
make term # Start the RIOT shell
```

... and you are in the RIOT shell!
Type `help` to discover available commands. For further information see the
[README of the `default` example](https://github.com/RIOT-OS/RIOT/tree/master/examples/default).

To use RIOT directly on your embedded platform, and for more hands-on details
with RIOT, see the Getting Started guide.

Before that, skimming through the next section is recommended (but not
mandatory).
