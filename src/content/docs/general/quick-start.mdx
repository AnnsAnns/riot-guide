You can run RIOT on most IoT devices, on open-access testbed hardware (e.g.
IoT-lab), and also directly as a process on your Linux or FreeBSD machine (we
call this the `native` port). Try it right now in your terminal window:

1. Clone the project (assumption: git is pre-installed)

```shell
git clone https://github.com/RIOT-OS/RIOT.git
```

2. Move to the RIOT directory:

```shell
cd RIOT
```

3. Checkout the latest release, you can find them under the [releases
   page](https://github.com/RIOT-OS/RIOT/tags):

```shell
git checkout <LATEST_RELEASE>
```

4. Create virtual Ethernet interfaces to connect multiple RIOT instances

```shell
sudo ./dist/tools/tapsetup/tapsetup
```

5. Go into the default example and build it:

```shell
cd examples/default/
make all
```

6. Launch the RIOT shell in a terminal:

```shell
make term
```

... and you are in the RIOT shell!
Type `help` to discover available commands. For further information see the
[README of the `default` example](https://github.com/RIOT-OS/RIOT/tree/master/examples/default).

To use RIOT directly on your embedded platform, and for more hands-on details
with RIOT, see @ref getting-started.

Before that, skimming through the next section is recommended (but not
mandatory).
