MCUFont is a font compression, decompression and rendering library for use with microcontroller systems.

IntroductionMCUFont is a stand-alone font compression, decompression and rendering library for use with microcontroller systems. On microcontrollers only decompression and rendering is supported, the compression part is written in C++ and is not supposed to be run on constrained devices.

MCUFont supports high quality rendering of supplied fonts with kerning and anti-aliasing support. It does not support font scaling.
