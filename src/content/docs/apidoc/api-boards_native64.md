# group `boards_native64` 

Support for running RIOT in native64.

[Family: native](https://github.com/RIOT-OS/RIOT/wiki/Family:-native)

Same board as [native](./doc/starlight-docs/src/content/docs/apidoc/api-undefined.md#group__boards__native), but compiled for 64-bit instead of 32-bit. Currently only Linux x86-64 is supported. Otherwise, everything works the same as for the 32-bit version. For more information on this board, see the [native board](./doc/starlight-docs/src/content/docs/apidoc/api-undefined.md#group__boards__native) documentation.
