Provides the Nordic nrfx HAL.

Introduction"nrfx is a standalone set of drivers for peripherals present in Nordic Semiconductor's SoCs. It originated as an extract from the nRF5 SDK. The intention was to provide drivers that can be used in various environments without the necessity to integrate other parts of the SDK into them. For the user's convenience, the drivers come with the MDK package. This package contains definitions of register structures and bitfields for all supported SoCs, as well as startup and initialization files for them."
