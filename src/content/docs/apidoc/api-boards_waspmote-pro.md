# group `boards_waspmote-pro` 

Support for the Waspmote PRO v1.2 board.

End of Life
> Deprecated: Support for the Waspmote Pro is scheduled for removal after the 2024-07 release.

This board is sold only B2B, so that our community members from the DIY/hobbyist community and academia do not have access to the board. Our community members from the industry mostly develop their own hardware and, therefore, have no interest in supporting this board. As result, none of the RIOT core contributors has access to the hardware, preventing us from doing the necessary testing for maintaining this board.

Pin Change InterruptsMore pins can be used for hardware interrupts using the Pin Change Interrupt feature. See [ATmega common](./doc/starlight-docs/src/content/docs/apidoc/api-undefined.md#group__boards__common__atmega) for details.
